            <h1> About Charlie </h1>
            <h3>Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (n√©e Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people.[1][2][3][4]
            <br>
            <br>There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London.[5][a] His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal guardian of Hannah's first son, Sydney John Hill.[9][b] At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker,[10] had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley,[11] while Charles Sr., a butcher's son,[12] was a popular singer.[13] Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891.[14] The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for thirty years.[15]</h3>
